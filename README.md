# CpG Detector (work in progress)

Predict the number of "CG" in the given string

**Report (Work in progress)** - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uF8eOnVi4QrO3cDNYDd1OFeRmaW3PqNt8gjZWluS1IE/edit?usp=sharing

**TODO** 
- Improve accuracy/performance metrics of LSTM model (maybe experiment with loss functions, increase model architecture!)

### For streamlit app
```
streamlit run app.py --server.headless=true
```

**Note:** Running in remote desktop is giving both Network and External URLs but returning "connection request"
